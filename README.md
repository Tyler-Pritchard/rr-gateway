### **API Gateway for Microservices Architecture using Go Fiber**

This repository contains a high-performance API Gateway built using Go Fiber, designed to manage microservices within a modular, scalable architecture. The gateway connects a React frontend to various backend services, including a Node.js-based authentication service and a GoLang-powered Stripe payment platform, with support for future multimedia and e-commerce microservices.

The gateway implements core industry-standard features such as request routing, JWT-based authentication, and rate limiting, with plans to extend functionality for gRPC, WebSockets, and service discovery. This project demonstrates a production-ready API gateway for handling real-world microservices, optimized for extensibility, security, and high performance.

Key Features:
- **Efficient HTTP Routing & Proxying** for RESTful microservices
- **JWT Authentication Middleware** for secure access control
- **Scalable Architecture** with support for multiple communication protocols
- **Modular Design** to accommodate evolving service requirements

Ideal for demonstrating professional microservices engineering practices in a high-performance GoLang environment.
